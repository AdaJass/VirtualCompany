>Main Idea: Combine blockchain technology with workflow.

>Aim: A system organizes people to do something and earn money. If a company can be seen as consisted by software and hardware, then this system will do almost all the software thing.

## Introduction And Inspiration
This system or idea might go further than my first thought. But I initially just wanted to build a small tool to make a *virtual company*. By the progress of society, many kinds of companies especilly digital technology type can work without the limitation of location. Beside, register a company hire venue and hire people will take extra resource and time. There is risk and too much trival work to do to be a originator. So, why a company has to be real?

Current digital currency brings a trusted solution other than the government. Maybe its vision is great that to make the world a union and to give people a second choice of reliable finance service. But this trust sacrifice a lot.

Digital technology company are almost dealing with digital data which can be transfered through internet. If work at the same spot, one might have to leave it's family to work in another city, tolerate hight house rent. Maybe the relationship between colleagues also sacrifice a lot. 

## Key Word
* Digital Currency
    >For convienion reason, I name this virtual coin Obe, it developes base on <a href="https://github.com/eosio/eos">Eosio</a> system, but get rid of the Proof of stake (PoS) strategy. Super nodes are configurable, usually acounts point to a real world reliable organization. New coins come from legal tender exchange with Obe. Super nodes manage the legal tender and get responsible for it.  
        

* Account
    >Obe wallet must belong to an account, an account can has many wallets. Each account points to real individual or organization. Account maintains infomation the role this account play in the whole system, and evidence to make further judgement. such as ability, relations between other account, reliability,...

    >Supper Account holds supper Nodes.

* Kickstarter
    >it is like kickstarter a little, here is the place where idea meets money. Suppose an idea get it's angel fund somehow, then they must come to an agreement that choose an account or a strategy to operate the *virtual company*.


* WorkFLow
    >Each node of the workflow chain is similiar, so they will share the same rule or logic.  In the real world, for example, the main workflow of a restaurant might be: attract customer -> receive orders -> produce food -> send to cumstomer. For each step/node of the workflow chain, there is a sub-workflow. The process of the sub-workflow will answer how to complete the task. For example the food produce procedure, it might contain several people coorperation, so itself is a workflow. It is a little like recursion or fractal in math.
    
    >Workflow can tell how to do things until meet the inseparable node, those nodes often need human operation and workflow waits for input. Workflow will auto run when the `start` situation meet, it runs to a node, inform the node processor, waiting for input. The input is limited and meaningful to the system, thus, the input will control the wokrflow execution. In general, the wokrflow just inform people in the right time.
    

* Virtual Company
    >Worflow almost define a company, it is the core, but there are some other things that a company need. They are money, privilige control, organization structure, accounts management, workflow setting adjust. These provide the resource for workflow.

    >Once a virtual company set, a new virtual account is bind to this company, this account operates the company setting supervisely by other account or other several accounts. And the funding Obe will automaticaly belong to this account. Let's call the super account to the company admin. Then, admin will set up the company main workflow. This phase of workflow is rough and need to be disintegrated. Tha admin has the privilige to set up all the whole workflow of the company, but it is complicated for this role, and seems inconvenience and stiff. In the workflow, we call the account has some special function *role*. A role can only control the workflow in its level, and should not do its finger in the sub-flow level. Role that play in the workflow chain will define the company structure, which relate to organization structure of traditional company. In real situation, the whole company workflow will be complicated, but for each individual/role/account, it is simple, what role you play, what workflow you define. 
    
    >For example, the restaurant case. A lazy boss will set up this flow:  
    >>`start condition(if Obe availabe > some scale)  -->  Find a CEO to build and run a restaurant`, then it only need to supervise the CEO's work.
    >The CEO concrete the task, separated them into several processes. Cause the flow is dynamic, in the restaurant build up time, The flow is `hire people to buy A/B/C --> hire worker to use A/B/C to decorate the dining room` The Obe is approved from the admin .

    >After the decoration, the flow will change to `[purchase , customer service , clean up ]` Each flow runs parallelly and bind to an individual, the CEO surpervise these three flow. 
    >Now the customer service operator may be the busy guy, but he doesn't do the whole thing. he seperate the flow into `[customer ordering, cooking, delivering]` each flow bind to an individual, he supervise each task outcome.

    >Till now, the task can't be separated any more. The lastest *binder* will do the real task. The leader supervise the task and give some direction support. In the customer service case, the ordering output is the input of cooking start condition, the leadar might just supervise the feedback of customers and the income.

    >Approver/supervisor/leader plays important role in virtual company, it is not recommend to use accounts unfamiliar in real world. The *leaders* might need to have conferences frequently to make adjust to organize structure or task separating and arragement. The most possible situation is that several leaders work together in real world at company start up phase.

* Job
    >if you have an account, you can find job on this system. Every job should pay Obe as salary and you can transfer Obe to legal tender with system or just hold Obe. Theoretically, every account can publish a job. A job consist of publisher/employer, approver, and employee. Employer pay Obe to approver and employee, sometimes employer and approver could be the same account. If a disagreement occurd, accounts managed by Super Account will make a judgement, the looser pay the arbitration fee and may leave to its reliability descrease.
    >Job's salary can be complicated to make employee do the job betterly. To make employee more royal to a company is an open question. But there is guarantee that employee can't against the company rules without punishment.


* Financing Platform
    >A well run virtual company can publish its own coins holds by digital currency system
